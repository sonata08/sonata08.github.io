                <p>According to the Constitution Ukrainian is the only official language in the country although Russian is widely spoken as well. 
                Ukrainian language dominates in the West while Russian in Eastern and Southern regions of the country. In Kyiv, capital of ukraine, Russian is more often in everyday life although Ukrainian is used in official institutions. 
                Ukrainian language is not very easy to learn. Its phonology and grammar may seem unusual for English speakers. Only native speakers of languages belonging to Slavic group can easily find some familiar words in it. In addition to that, Ukrainians use Cyrillic alphabet, and that often causes complexities to our foreign visitors who are used to latin letters.</p>
