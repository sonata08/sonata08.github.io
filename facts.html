                <div id="fact1">Within Ukraine is the geographical centre of Europe. It's not quite as simple as that. A number of locations lay claim to the title and it depends on how you measure Europe, but the small town of Rakhiv in western Ukraine is one such place.

                <div id="fact3">Arsenalna station is located 105.5 meters below the surface, making it the deepest metro station in the world. If you made a vertical shaft on earth as deep, you could drop the entire Statue of Liberty into it and still have more than twelve meters of headroom left to drop other stuff. To board a subway train at this station, commuters have to take two seemingly never-ending escalators to the bottom. The journey takes up to five minutes.<p class="f3"><img src="img/arsenalna_metro_station.jpg" alt="Arsenalna Metro Station"class="img-responsive"></p></div>
